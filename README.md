# hello-world
this is my first programm in GitHub
i am a student at the university of Regensburg, which is in Germany. At the moment iam studiying medical informatics and i must say it is really fun getting to understand alot about coding of computer science even in the medical field. This type of study i would definately recommend. Its really interesting. I am currently at the verge of learning new programming techniuecs and that includes also learning how to deverlope a software (self thought)
